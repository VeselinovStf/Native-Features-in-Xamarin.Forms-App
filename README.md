![Final demos presentation]()

## Course Info

- Xamarin.Forms will let you create applications for multiple platforms using a shared codebase. This course will teach you how to use multiple techniques for accessing native platform features that are not directly exposed to the Xamarin.Forms.

- When working in Xamarin.Form there are multiple ways to access native features. In this course, Working with Native Features in Xamarin.Forms Applications, you'll learn how to be able to access features specific to a platform from your Xamarin code. First, you will explore how to use Xamarin.Essentials to access settings and components that are common to multiple platforms. Next, you will see how to use the Device class to access device physical characteristics and make threadsafe UI calls from background threads. Then, you will delve into how to use the DependencyService class to access native features and extend existing functionality at the platform level. Finally, you will discover how to use Dependency Injection with the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection library as another way to access platform specific features. When you have finished the course, you will have the skills needed to access native features for your applications.
